The amount of time taken for an algorithm to execute is known as the time complexity. It is expressed as a function of input length using the big O notation. It can also be represented using the Theta notation. Common method by which time complexity is calculated is by the number of operations within an algorithm. 

There are a number of time complexities that exist. Some of which include the O(n) which is the linear time complexity. O(n<sup>2</sup>), O(n<sup>3</sup>), O(n<sup>k</sup>) are the quadratic, cubic, and polynomial time complexities, respectively. O(log n) is the logarithmic time complexity. Here, n is the input size.

The first graph from the code file which shows all the time complexities plotted on a single axes indicates that logarithmic time complexity is the best. This is because it is the fastest as it takes the least amount of time. However, for further evidence, there is a second graph which consists of the time complexities on separate axes. Here, using the input that has been provided, it can be clearly seen that the logarithmic function takes the least amount of time. We can also see increasing running time for the linear, quadratic, cubic and polynomial time complexities with the same input size of 7. Hence, we can conclude that logarithmic time complexity is the best.
